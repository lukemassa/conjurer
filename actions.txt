# This file contains a list of allowable actions.
# The format for each entry is as follows
# The first line is the name of the verb followed by the theta roles
# The next chunk of lines (indented by one tab) are relations that
#       must hold for the action to be done.
# The final chunk (indented by two tabs) are relations that will
#	occur after the action is done.
# Note that throughout that 0 refers to the Conjurer (with the theta
#	role "person").
